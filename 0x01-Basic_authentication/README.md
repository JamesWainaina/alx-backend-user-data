**Project Duration:** July 8, 2024, 6:00 AM to July 10, 2024, 6:00 AM  
**Weight:** 1  
**Auto QA Review:** 0.0/169 mandatory & 0.0/27 optional  
**Overall Score:** 0.0%

## In a Nutshell
In this project, you will learn about the authentication process and implement Basic Authentication on a simple API. This project is for learning purposes, and you will be implementing each step of the Basic Authentication mechanism to understand it thoroughly.

## Background Context
In the industry, it's recommended to use modules or frameworks for Basic Authentication (e.g., Flask-HTTPAuth for Python-Flask). However, for learning purposes, this project requires you to implement Basic Authentication from scratch.

## Resources
Read or watch the following resources to understand the concepts better:
- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms](#)
- [Base64 in Python](#)
- [HTTP header Authorization](#)
- [Flask](#)
- [Base64 - concept](#)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without using Google:
- What authentication means
- What Base64 is
- How to encode a string in Base64
- What Basic Authentication means
- How to send the Authorization header

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Documentation
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Documentation should be more than just a single word; it should be a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length will be verified.
